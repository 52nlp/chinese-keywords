chinese-keywords
================

Contained is a set of sensitive Chinese keywords (that is, keywords related to the Chinese Communist party, pornography, dissident material, violence/terrorism, censorship, etc). These keywords may be helpful to researchers who are searching for sensitive content in Chinese or testing for network interference.

As of Dec 9, there are 9,054 sensitive keywords collected from 13 different lists (see below for detailed info on the lists). To get a sense of what data is included in these CSV files, you can view a Google Doc spreadsheet of these 9,054 keywords sorted by the number of lists they appear on: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19eS47Dg086vR1jh9oo51pXstYVT2wft13JGCrnAeU7A/edit?usp=sharing

The CSV files contain machine translations (from Google) and human translations/notes for most of the keywords. Many also have theme and category variables included as well thanks to various sources which have previously tagged their keyword lists. Currently, there are three different versions:
* __all.csv__: all the keywords, all available data/variables, plus 3,987 popular (3,803 non-sensitive) keywords which can be used as possible controls for searching. These popular/non-sensitive keywords were taken from [article titles of the top 1000 most viewed articles on Wikipedia China in April 2013](http://stats.grok.se/zh/top) (995 after a few Wikipedia meta-pages were removed) and  [titles of articles that generated more than a total of 10 combined views on August 1, 0:00-1:00 and 12:00-13:00](http://dumps.wikimedia.org/other/pagecounts-raw/2013/2013-08/).
* __no-dummy-vars-for-categories-and-themes.csv__: all the keywords without dummy variables for each of the themes and categories that were tagged by The Citizen Lab. Category/theme info is instead stored in catch-all "category" and "theme" variable (column). 
* __no-dummy-vars-for-categories-and-themes_only-sensitive-words.csv__: same as above except also with the non-sensitive words removed.
Once downloaded, you can also sort by keyword length as well as how many of the lists each keyword appears on.
